# specdx

## 0.4.0-alpha.4

### Minor Changes

- d246c79: Focus specdx on its core identity: the context engine for spec-driven development.
  - `check`, `check --ai`, `update --from-code`, `generate test-plan`, and `migrate` are now flagged `[experimental]` in CLI help — they remain fully functional but are not part of the stable surface
  - README rewritten around the core loop: validate → lint → pack → keep fresh
  - `status`, `ready`, `explain`, `diff`, and `changelog` now print a friendly error instead of a stack trace when no `spec.config.yaml` exists
  - MCP server: per-tool test coverage for all 7 tools and corrected server version
